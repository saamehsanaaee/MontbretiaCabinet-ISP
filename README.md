## Data
- The first step was to determine the type of data that we will be using, which, in our case is the time series BOLD signals.
- Second, we decided to use the subset of HCP data that had been preprocesses and shared by Neuromatch Academy in OSF. This data subset is accessible in [Neuromatch OSF page](https://osf.io/hygbm/) and downloadable through codes provided in the [computational neuroscience course content](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/projects/fMRI/README.html#:~:text=HCP%20task%20datasets,Murray%2C%20Saad%20Jbabdi) from Neuromatch academy.
